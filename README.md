# Customer_Care_Chat_Bot
Design a python based interactive semi - rule based chatbot which can do the following:
1. Start chat session with greetings and ask what the user is looking for.
2. Accept dynamic text based questions from the user. Reply back with relevant answer from the designed corpus.
3. End the chat session only if the user requests to end else ask what the user is looking for. Loop continues till the user asks to end it. Hint: There are a lot of techniques using which one can clean and prepare the data which can be used to train a ML/DL classifier. Hence, it might require you to experiment, research, self learn and implement the above classifier. There might be many iterations between hand building the corpus and designing the best fit text classifier. As the quality and quantity of corpus increases the modelâ€™s performance i.e. ability to answer right questions also increases.
